config to force enable materials, set material overrides that aren't handled by default compat, etc
autogen recipes for parts, (ie allow nuggets to ingots, ingots to blocks to be autogenned on a part based on a value), doing this modularly so mods can add their own recipes automagically

1.12 1:1 recreation for eas(y)|(ier) porting
api for implementing out of world breeding and processing (ie an api for things like forestry bees, the chickens mod, etc)

#hardcore
things that probably are too advanced for this project but are ideal
caching, everything, literally everything
out of world machine processing, attach machines, cables, etc all to a virtual network and run that network even when chunks arent loaded, less laggy, no chunkloaders
the last one, but offloaded to multiple threads
full version abstraction, so the api just had to be ported to whatever MC version but the mods could remain intact

retroactively removing materialparts if something sharing their oredict is detected
fabric support
compatiblity with java 1:1 mc rewrites
